**Welcome to the my applicationâœ¨**

**Description:**
Welcome to the Trade Control System with security README. This document provides an overview of the Commerce control application, its features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
This project encompasses a Spring Boot application designed to manage product, category, and supplier-related operations in a PostgreSQL database. 
The application provides a comprehensive set of features to facilitate effective management of various aspects of your business:

**Key Features:**
- Product: Empowers users to control every aspect of their products. Easily list, update, and delete products, aiding businesses in organizing inventory.
- Category: Users can add, modify, and delete product categories. Each product can belong to one or multiple categories, simplifying filtering and searching.
- Supplier: Organize supplier relationships. Add, update, or remove suppliers as needed. Associate products with suppliers for quick access to supplier details.
- Data Integrity and Validation: Ensures data integrity with custom validation rules. Prevents errors, like negative prices, and enforces category-specific rules, enhancing data quality.
- Database Relationship Management: Effectively manages relationships between database objects. Easily specify product-category or product-supplier associations for improved data organization.

**User Authentication and Security:**
- User Sign-up: Users can register and create an account using the `/register` endpoint. After registration, an email confirmation link is sent to the user's email address.
- Email Confirmation: Users must click the confirmation link in the email to verify their email address and activate their account.
- User Login: Registered users can log in using the `/login` endpoint, which provides them with a JWT token for authentication.
- JWT Token: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication and authorization. The token is provided upon login and must be included in the headers of authenticated requests.
- Token Refresh: To maintain security and session longevity, users can use the `/refresh` endpoint to get a new access token without re-entering credentials.
